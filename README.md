*Erm it's audio, so just imagine it?*

### What is it?

CLI-Boom is a simple, lightweight script for Zsh that plays sounds for specific commands.

*   Type `kubectl` and hear a satisfying **Vine Boom**.
*   Run `git push --force` and hear the **Among Us Impostor** sound, giving you one last chance to reconsider your life choices.

### Installation

Just paste this one command into your terminal. It works on macOS and Linux (with Zsh).

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cli-boom/main/install.sh)"
```

After installing, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc`.

### Customization

Want to change the sounds or the commands?

The installer places everything in your `~/.zshrc` file within clear markers (`# --- CLI-Boom Start ---`). You can edit this section directly to change the commands or point to different sound files located in the `~/.cli-boom` directory.
